# FX Web Application

Built with Python and Flask, hoping to create a basic web application that calls an currency converter api and converts the data in the backend so that users can get their chosen currency converted in realtime.

TDD will be used to drive the project, and will do my best to use all the materials I have previously, as well as the internet (barring AI), in order to complete it
